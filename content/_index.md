## What is Connection Machine?

Connection Machine is an open-source and cross-platform desktop application for designing and simulating digital circuits at scale. It is being built as a university project for [RCOS](https://handbook.rcos.io/#/?id=main). You can get a build of the application from the [releases page](https://github.com/Martian-Technologies/Connection-Machine/releases/) on GitHub.

## Features

- **Tensor connect**: Allows you to perform enormous connections by projecting your circuit across space.
- **Fast simulation**: We use a custom-built simulation engine that can simulate entire computers in real-time.
- **Open-source**: All our code is open-source and free to use. You can contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Martian-Technologies/Connection-Machine).
- **Custom components**: Create your own components and use them in your designs.

## Planned features

- **GPU acceleration**: Use your GPU to perform simulations at blazing speeds.
- **Real-world interaction**: Connect your designs to the real world to play sounds, or play a game with a controller.
- **Online circuit catalog**: Share your designs with the world and download designs from others.
